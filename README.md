# Part1
Introduction: In this section I will clearly define the idea of my choosing, where I leverage the Foursquare location data to solve the imagined business opportunity.

Chicago is a colorful city, people could fulfill their dreams here and they also might loss their money due to the bad choice in thier business. My friend Kelly just graduated from University and he wants to invest several restaurants in  Chicago.  Therefore, I am going to find the best location of restaraunts in New York city for my fiend Kelly. 
I will combine with the rates of crimes, top sites in city, the income and population of each neighborhood as well as the competitors already present on the same regions.

To provide him with the necessary information, I'll be combining  Chicago's 2016 Census that contains Population, Average income per Neighborhood with  Chicago's Neighborhoods shapefile and Foursquare API to collect competitors on the same neighborhoods
