# Part1:
# Introduction: 
In this section I will clearly define the idea of my choosing, where I leverage the Foursquare location data to solve the imagined business opportunity.

Toronto is a colorful city, people could fulfill their dreams here and they also might loss their money due to the bad choice in thier business. My friend Kelly just graduated from University and he wants to find a neighborhood in Toronto to live.  Therefore, I am going to find the best location of neighborhood in Toronto for my fiend Kelly. 
I will combine with the rates of crimes, top sites in city, the income and population of each neighborhood as well as the educated level present on the same regions.

# problems:
The major purpose of this project, is to suggest a better neighborhood in a new city for the Kelly who firstly comes there. Social presence in society in terms of like minded people. Connectivity to the airport, bus stand, city center, markets and other daily needs things nearby.

Sorted list of house in terms of housing prices in a ascending or descending order
Sorted list of schools in terms of location, fees, rating and reviews


To provide him with the necessary information, I'll be combining  Chicago's 2016 Census that contains Population, Average income per Neighborhood with  Chicago's Neighborhoods shapefile and Foursquare API to collect competitors on the same neighborhoods

# Foursquare API:
This project would use Four-square API as its prime data gathering source as it has a database of millions of places, especially their places API which provides the ability to perform location search, location sharing and details about a business.

# Libraries Which are Used to Develope the Project:
Pandas: For creating and manipulating dataframes.

Folium: Python visualization library would be used to visualize the neighborhoods cluster distribution of using interactive leaflet map.

Scikit Learn: For importing k-means clustering.

JSON: Library to handle JSON files.

XML: To separate data from presentation and XML stores data in plain text format.

Geocoder: To retrieve Location Data.

Beautiful Soup and Requests: To scrap and library to handle http requests.

Matplotlib: Python Plotting Module.
